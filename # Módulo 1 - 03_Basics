  ## Basic Notions_Module_01_Vectors

#1 Create a numeric vector from 1 until 100
Tripa <- seq(1:100)
typeof (Tripa)

## Exploring vectors of different natures, which can be: character, logical, integer or double.


#2 Create a numeric vector from 101 until 200
Tripa2 <- seq(101:200)
typeof(Tripa2)

#3 Create a character vector repeating any word you like 20 times
#3.1 Use a proper command for repetition ### Yep!
Tiger <- rep('Slavery no more!', 20)
typeof(Tiger)

#4 Name your numeric vectors, using the proper command


#5 Make a series of operations with your numeric vectors:
#5.1 Sum them and save to a new variable
#5.2 Subtract them and and save to a new variable
#5.3 Use the two first vectors in a Exponentiation (squared or cubed) and save the result in two new variables

#6 Post your results to Google Classroom in a text file so everyone can see
